This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Introduction

MedHive is a revolutionary platform that simplifies the process of booking a hospital bed. With this, patients can book a bed from the comfort of their homes and avoid the hassle of waiting in long queues at the hospital. This platfrom aims to provide a seamless experience to patients.

For now, platform is using just Odisha Hospital names and the dummy data around it. The appointment is showed in our database.

One of the key features of MedHive is the real-time bed/cost information. Patients can use the app to check the availability of beds in the hospital in real-time, enabling them to plan their visits accordingly. They can also get an estimate of the cost of room and can select the best hospital.

Another feature is that the platform provides patients with a directory of all the specialties available in the hospital, along with their location.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
